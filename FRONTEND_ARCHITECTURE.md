# Zurura Frontend System Architecture & Design

## Introduction

The Zurura frontend is a modern, responsive web application built with Next.js 15, React 19, and TypeScript. It provides an intuitive interface for bus booking, tracking, and management, serving multiple user types including commuters, operators, and drivers.

## Technology Stack

### Core Framework: Next.js 15
- **Why**: Server-side rendering, file-based routing, API routes, and excellent TypeScript support
- **Advantages**: 
  - Better SEO and initial load performance
  - Simplified routing and code organization
  - Built-in API routes and image optimization
- **Limitations**: Learning curve for complex features, hosting platform dependencies

### UI Framework: React 19
- **Why**: Component-based architecture, virtual DOM, large ecosystem
- **Advantages**:
  - Declarative UI development
  - Rich ecosystem
  - Excellent performance
- **Limitations**: Bundle size growth, additional libraries needed

### Styling: Tailwind CSS
- **Why**: Utility-first approach, customization, performance
- **Advantages**:
  - Rapid development
  - Consistent design system
  - Small bundle size
- **Limitations**: Verbose HTML, learning curve for complex layouts

### State Management: React Query
- **Why**: Server state management, caching, real-time updates
- **Advantages**:
  - Automatic background updates
  - Built-in caching
  - Optimistic updates
- **Limitations**: Learning curve, can be overkill for simple features

### Form Management: React Hook Form + Zod
- **Why**: Performance, type safety, validation
- **Advantages**:
  - Minimal re-renders
  - Type-safe forms
  - Built-in validation
- **Limitations**: Learning curve for complex forms

### UI Components: Radix UI
- **Why**: Accessibility, unstyled components, composition
- **Advantages**:
  - Excellent accessibility
  - Complete styling control
  - Type-safe components
- **Limitations**: Requires styling setup, limited components

## Architecture

### Project Structure
```
frontend/
├── app/                    # Next.js app router pages
│   ├── auth/              # Authentication pages
│   ├── commuter/          # Commuter-specific pages
│   ├── operator/          # Operator-specific pages
│   ├── profile/           # User profile pages
│   └── layout.tsx         # Root layout

├── lib/                   # Utility functions and hooks
├── types/                 # TypeScript type definitions
└── public/               # Static assets
```

### Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design Pattern**:
  - Atoms: Basic building blocks
  - Molecules: Component combinations
  - Organisms: Complex components
  - Templates: Page layouts
  - Pages: Complete views

### Data Flow
1. **API Layer**: Centralized API client with type safety
2. **State Management**: 
   - Server state: React Query
   - Client state: React Context + Hooks
   - Form state: React Hook Form
3. **Data Fetching**:
   - Server-side: getServerSideProps
   - Client-side: React Query hooks
   - Real-time: WebSocket connections
